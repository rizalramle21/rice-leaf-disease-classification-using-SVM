# Rice Leaf Disease Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This repository contains my undergraduate thesis project focused on classifying rice leaf diseases using machine learning, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The objective is to assist early detection of common rice plant diseases through image-based classification.

## ðŸ§ª Tools and Technologies

- Python (Google Colab)
- OpenCV for image processing
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) for texture feature extraction
- Dataset from Kaggle and own doc

## ðŸ§  Methodology

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Resize, filter noise, and segment green leaf area.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract texture features using GLCM.
3. **Model Training**: Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- Achieved 85% classification accuracy.
- Performed well in detecting diseases such as Brown Spot, Leaf Smut, and Hispa.
- See `results/` folder for metrics and visual outputs.
